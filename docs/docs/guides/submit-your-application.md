# Submit your Application

Before going to production, your application must be whitelisted to use FastAuth.

## Approval Process

1. **Submit your application** for review with the following information:
   - Application name and description
   - Expected user volume
   - Use case details
   - Contact information

2. **Review**: The FastAuth team will review your application and may request additional information.

3. **Approval**: Once approved, you will receive:
   - Production Auth0 credentials (`domain`, `clientId`, `audience`)
   - Access to production FastAuth contracts
   - Documentation for production deployment

For information about the production contracts, see the [FastAuth Contract architecture](../concepts/architecture_contracts_fa).

## Development vs. Production

| Environment | Purpose | Credentials |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Testnet** | Development and testing | Use testnet credentials (no approval required) |
| **Mainnet** | Production applications | Requires whitelisting and approved credentials |
